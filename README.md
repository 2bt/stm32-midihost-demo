stm32-midihost-demo
===================

this demoes how to use midi host


In this demo I use the KORG nanoKONTROL 2 

Note: before you can control the LEDs of the nanoKONTROL with midi messages you have to change "LED MODE" to "external" usign the KORG Kontrol Editor.

this demo flashes the upper left LED of the nanoKONTROL an echoes back all midi messages (which toggles the LEDs under the buttons on the nanoKONTROL)
